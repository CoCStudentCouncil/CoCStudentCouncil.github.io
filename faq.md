## <a name="spaces"></a> Questions about space, building access and locations

# Why did the TA labs move? Why is there so much reshuffling of offices in CCB?
The opening of the CODA building at Tech Square opened up the opportunity to shift away the large research labs occupying the CCB. This made about 3,300 new square footage of space available. In an effort to return this space to students, the adminsitration partnered with instructional staff to make this space, much larger in square footage than the total space on the 1st floor, available for TA use. At the close of Fall 2019, all of the TA lab spaces (CS 1301, 1331, 1332, 2340, 2110, 2200, etc) moved up to the newly vacated 2nd floor, while staff members managing important student-facing services (such as Career Services) moved down from the 3rd floor into these offices. 

# Where’d the Nest go?
The Nest wass a quiet study space on the 3rd floor that usually did not see much student traffic. The Nest is now being renovated into a conference room for the administrators who now reside on the 3rd floor. There is a plan to open a new quiet study space for students on the first floor in Spring 2020. 

# Why is my class so far away?
 Classroom location allotment is based on expected class sizes and is done well in advance for a given semester. There are only so many locations across campus that are able to safely house large numbers of students (like over 100). A few examples of classrooms that can hold close to 200 students include those in Paper, Scheller, CCB's basement, and the IC. Ultimately, where your class is located comes down to space, faculty availability, and expected class sizes.

# Who gets access to CODA? 
CODA access is only open to the GT departments that now reside in CODA and since the Institute doesn’t own the entire building – leased spaces – access is permitted for employees and staff of GT offices, non-GT companies with space, and anyone willing to pay for WeWork space.  When the retail and dining spaces open, students and the community will have access to that.  For tours, you’d have to email Portman Holdings to see if there’s a public tour available or to set up a student tour if allowed.


## <a name="classes"></a> Questions about prereqs, threads and classes

# Why did the College of Computing remove the Linear Algebra Bridge Course? 
The "Linear Algebra Bridge Course" (MATH 2802 - Applications of Linear Algebra) was a course restricted to CS students with credit for MATH 1553, MATH 1502 or MATH 1522 to help change of majors satisfy their MATH 1554 credit. Unfortunately, this course was offered by the Math Department, not the Computer Science department, which means we can only speculate as to why the course is no longer offered (perhaps staffing the course was difficult). Advisors recommend that every current or prospective CS student register for MATH 1554. 

# Some courses are only offered in the Fall or Spring, which makes it hard to plan so that you graduate. Can we address courses like this?
The CoC makes sure that core classes are always offered in the Fall and Spring. Offering certain thread picks and electives, on the other hand, depend on the availability of the instructional staff ready to teach them. If you are concerned about delaying graduation,be assured that you will always be able to find an alternative class that satisfies a thread pick every semester.

## <a name="grad"></a> Questions about graduating, grad school and career

# Do we have resources for those interested in grad school? 
Yes! The CoC is growing the budget for such resources at an advising and career services level. Keep an eye out for the Graduate School Dinner event hosted by the CoC, Theory and Agency organizations.
