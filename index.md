# Purpose
The purpose of Student Council is to:
* Organize **Town Halls** to provide a platform for all Georgia Tech College of Computing (CoC) students to organize and freely discuss issues concerning the CoC and its future;
* Establish a **direct communication** channel between the CoC students and the Dean of the CoC;
* Ensure that the **voices of the CoC students** are heard and taken into account when decisions concerning the future of the CoC are made by the CoC Administration.

# Members and Meetings
**Every CoC student is a member by default.** Any member can show up to a meeting and participate. Meetings are run in a formal manner, and the meeting outcomes are compiled in a document, which is then shared with the members of the CoC administration. Student Council aims to be the main medium for the organized discussions of the students about the CoC. You are invited to our first "founding" Town Hall meeting on Thursday, **November 15th at 8PM in Klaus** (TBD, please check back near the meeting). The aim of the founding meeting will be to go over the structure of the organization, get feedback from members, and likely make changes based on the popular opinion.

# Officers
Student Council involves two sets of officers: **Executive Board** officers and **Student Advisory Board** officers. Executive Board officers are tasked to run the meetings, manage the organization, and communicate the results of the meetings to the CoC administration. Student Advisory Board officers represent their respective groups, and are expected to be available to advise both the Student Council members and the CoC administration about their groups' points of view on a particular topic. Student Advisory Board includes a  representative(s) from:
* **1st & 2nd year** undergraduate students,
* **3rd and 4th+ year** undergraduate students,
* **MS** students,
* **PhD** students,
* **CM** majors,
* **teaching assistants**,
* **research assistants**,
* **student organizations**,
* the two undergraduate **SGA representatives** for the CoC

# FAQ

## I read the description, but what exactly is Student Council?

We meet for 2 to 3 hours. Members make motions to discuss specific topics. After the discussion, members can make motions to add the discussed item to the meeting resolution, which is to be shared with the CoC administration in a one on one meeting. Student Council allows students to discuss CoC related issues that concern them with their peers, and express the results collectively.

## What are some examples of the topics we can discuss in Student Council?

You can discuss anything as long as it is inline with the institute policies. Perhaps you find the CoC commons a little boring, and would like the CoC to make some changes to it. Maybe you have a course suggestion. Maybe you really want the CoC to consider hiring this specific professor for a vacant role. Perhaps you have a suggestion to the Devices thread curriculum. List goes on. Student Council will make sure that the correct people hear your suggestions and concerns, and if possible, the steps are taken to make it a reality.

## I am a 1st year, can I participate?

Please do! We are very old people and we need some young blood. Actually though, we need some people to make sure the organization continues, as most of the current organizer team is graduating soon.

## Was there a similar organizations in the CoC before?
Student Council is a result of the ongoing restructuring efforts of the student leadership structure in the College of Computing and a more inclusive continuation to the <a href="https://ucouncil.github.io/">Undergraduate Council</a>.
