# Purpose
The purpose of Student Council is to:
* To provide a platform for all Georgia Tech College of Computing (CoC) students to meet and freely discuss issues concerning the CoC and its future;
* Establish a **direct communication** channel between the CoC students and the administration of the CoC;
* Ensure that the **voices of the CoC students** are heard and taken into account when decisions concerning the future of the CoC are made by the CoC Administration.

# Membership
**Every CoC student is a member by default.** Any member can show up to a meeting and participate. Meetings are run in an organized manner, and the meeting outcomes are compiled in a document, which is then shared with the members of the CoC administration. Student Council aims to be the main student forum for organized discussions about the CoC.
